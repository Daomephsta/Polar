Because it has two opposing forces, I have decided to call magic using either $(blue_magic) or $(red_magic) polar magic. When I use a polar artifact, it sometimes leaves a small residual charge on me,"

It seems I will have to choose between $(blue_magic) and $(red_magic), as more energetic polaric annihilations will cause major damage. Continuing to use the low power artifacts created only using $(blue_resource_all) and $(red_resource_all) should be safe enough however."
