	# Gravitic
    # Stabiliser
	To ease mining deposits of  
	gravity-affected blocks I have  
	designed a Vermillis trinket to  
	stabilise them.  
	My Gravitic Stabiliser stabilises  
	any unstable block above any  
	block I break, for a small Charge  
	cost. I can also stabilise blocks  
	by using it on them.  
	It is charged by the method  
	described in [Charging Items](inscribe://polar:research_journal/basics/item_charging).  
    The stabilising enchantment is  
    fragile, it'll stand up to walking  
    and jumping; but a good hit will  
    break it, causing the stabilised  
    block to fall.
