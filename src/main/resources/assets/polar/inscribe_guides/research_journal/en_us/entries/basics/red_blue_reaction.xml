	# Polaric 
	# Annihilation
	While using some of the artifacts  
	I have created, I discovered  
	Azuras and Vermillis react  
	violently when in contact.  
	As it has two opposing forces,  
	I have decided to call this magic  
	"polar magic".  
	Using a polar artifact sometimes  
	leaves a small residual charge,  
	resulting in a small shock when  
	an artifact of the opposing magic  
	is used.  
	Since the reaction destroys an  
	equal amount of both magics, I  
	call it 'polaric annihilation'.  
	It seems I will have to choose  
	between Azuras and Vermillis,  
	as more energetic polaric  
	annihilations will cause major  
	damage.
