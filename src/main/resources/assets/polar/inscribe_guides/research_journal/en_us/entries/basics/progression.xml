	# Progression
	Welcome to Polar! Progression in  
	Polar is fairly simple, there are  
	two ways to progress in Polar.  
	
	The first is by completing certain  
	tasks, which are tracked using  
	advancements. The second way  
	will be revealed later.  
	
	Most of the initial  
	advancements are in the  
	Adventure tab, the first one is  
	called Polar, all other Polar  
	advancements in that tab are  
	descendants of it. The rest of  
	Polar's advancements are in  
	Polar's own tabs.  
	
	Any Polar goal advancement  
	(curved top and bottom) will  
	unlock one or more entries once  
	completed. The description hints  
	at how to unlock it, as does one  
	of the entries unlocked by the  
	parent advancement.
