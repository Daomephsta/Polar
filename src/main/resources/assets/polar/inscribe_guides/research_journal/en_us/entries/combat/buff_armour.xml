	# Improving 
	# Armour
	I have discovered that redstone  
	focuses the energy of the red  
	anomalies, which I call Vermillis.  
	Now that I have samples of  
	Vermillis in the form of  
	Flawed Vermillium, I can  
	investigate uses.  
	It seems to have an affinity for  
	defense, I've designed a simple  
	ward to increase the protection  
	of any piece of armour.  
    Applying the ward requires only  
    the armour piece and  
    Flawed Vermillium.
