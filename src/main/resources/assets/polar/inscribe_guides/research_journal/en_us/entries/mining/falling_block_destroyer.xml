	# Percussive
	# Disintegrator
	While mining I often have trouble  
	mining through deposits of  
	gravel and other similar blocks.  
	As soon as I mine one block, the  
	gap is immediately filled by  
	another falling from above!  
	To solve this problem I have  
	designed an Azuras trinket that  
	destroys an entire column of  
	these blocks at once.  
    The Percussive Disintegrator  
    uses a small amount of Charge  
    per block destroyed, and is  
    charged by the method described  
    in [Charging Items](inscribe://polar:research_journal/basics/item_charging).
