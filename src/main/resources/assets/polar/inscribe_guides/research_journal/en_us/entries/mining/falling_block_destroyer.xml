	# Percussive
	# Disintegrator
	To ease mining deposits of
	gravity-affected blocks I have
	designed an Azuras trinket that  
	destroys an entire column of  
	these blocks at once.  
    The Percussive Disintegrator  
    uses a small amount of Charge  
    per block destroyed, and is  
    charged by the method described  
    in [Charging Items](inscribe://polar:research_journal/basics/item_charging).
