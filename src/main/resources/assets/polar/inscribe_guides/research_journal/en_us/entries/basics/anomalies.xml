	# Anomalies
	While exploring I've found  
	strange objects that radiate an  
	unknown form of energy.  
	There are two colours of these  
	'anomalies'; blue anomalies, which  
	appear near sunrise;  
	and red anomalies, which appear  
	near sunset.
	
	After a few days, anomalies   
	disappear naturally.  
	I suspect it is possible to  
	prevent or hasten this event.  
	My next step is to find a way to  
	focus their power.  
	I will leave samples of materials  
	near each kind.  
	Redstone, lapis, glowstone, and  
	gold seem like good candidates.
