	# Improving
	# Weapons
	I have discovered lapis lazuli  
	focuses the energy of the blue  
	anomalies, which I call Azuras.  
	Now that I have samples of  
	Azuras in the form of  
	Flawed Azurane I can investigate  
	uses.  
	It seems to have an affinity for  
	offense, I've designed a simple  
	charm to increase the damage  
	done by any weapon.  
    Applying the charm requires only  
    the weapon and Flawed Azurane.
