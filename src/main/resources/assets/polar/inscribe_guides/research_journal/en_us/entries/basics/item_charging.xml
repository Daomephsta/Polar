	# Charging Items
    Certain items, such as the  
    Gravitic Stabiliser, require Polar  
    magic to function. Vermillis and  
    Azuras items are charged by  
    crafting them with Azurane and  
    Vermillium, respectively.  
    The Charge stored in an item is  
    displayed in its tooltip.
