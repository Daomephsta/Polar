Most of the initial advancements are in the Adventure tab, the first one is called Polar, all other Polar advancements in that tab are descendants of it. The rest of Polar's advancements are in Polar's own tabs."

The description of an advancement hints at how to unlock it, as does one of the entries unlocked by the parent advancement. The second way will be revealed later, when it's useful."
